# AITU_project_task92
The project contains subprojects. There is no beautiful structure. Code dump in general lol. KMGLift - child of this project.

The DNN project is of interest.

Implemented the idea of autogradient and neural network training without additional libraries. I implemented a two-dimensional matrix, not a tensor, and everything is tailored for the matrix.
